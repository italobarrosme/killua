### Changelog <a name="changelog"></a>

The changelog file at the root of the project should be updated with the changes made in the PR. The changelog should be updated following the [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/) format. This is important to keep track of the changes made in the application and to track what will be on each release.

On changelog the section `[Unreleased]` should include the changes that are on development, following the pattern:

```md
[Unreleased]

- Feature XXX - Branch: feat/xxx
- SubFeature XXX - Branch: chore/xxx 
- Fix XXX - Branch: fix/xxx
```

The section signed with the version number should include the changes that will be released on that version, following the pattern:

```md
## [VERSION] - YYYY-MM-DD

### Added

- What's new in this version

### Changed

- What's changed in this version. Fix, refactor, etc.

### Removed

- What's removed in this version
```

The version number should follow the [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) format.

The ideal is to update the changelog as the changes are made, but if this is not possible, the developer who is merging the PR should update the changelog with the changes made in the PR. The person responsible for the release should review the changelog before releasing the new version and make any necessary changes.

### Commits <a name="commits"></a>

For commits, it is ideal to use the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) standards for better project organization. The Conventional Commits specification is a lightweight convention for commit messages. It offers a simple set of rules for creating a clear commit history, making it easier to develop automated tools. This convention involves describing the features, fixes, and breaking changes made in commit messages.
